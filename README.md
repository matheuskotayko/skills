# skills

Personal collection of agent skills (SKILL.md files) for Claude Code, Codex, and other agents that support the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) format.

## Why this repo

Central place to keep skills I use across machines and agents, installable anywhere with one command instead of copy-pasting files into each tool's config folder.

## Install

Install everything:

```
npx skills add matheusgmello/skills
```

Install a specific skill:

```
npx skills add matheusgmello/skills --skill <skill-name>
```

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| [marclou-review](skills/marclou-review/SKILL.md) | Reviews a landing page / product page / marketing copy against Marc Lou's 31 rules for viral products. |
| [grill-while-coding](skills/grill-while-coding/SKILL.md) | Pauses mid-implementation to question business-rule or architectural decisions as they're written, keeping the user aligned with the code. |
| [write-a-skill](skills/write-a-skill/SKILL.md) | Creates new agent skills with proper structure, progressive disclosure, and bundled resources. |
| [pentest-me](skills/pentest-me/SKILL.md) | Attacks your own system as a red team before it ships and scores each attack by how many independent layers stop it (defense in depth), then writes fix reports. Maps the HTTP attack surface from code and covers 12 vectors (IDOR, mass assignment, injection, SSRF, XSS/CSRF, path traversal, upload, XXE, and more). Includes a static-audit mode (stack detection, isolation-mechanism mapping, frontend/backend role cross-check, every-handler walk) that emits a file-by-file report with ready-to-paste GitHub issues and an optional PDF. |
| [quality-gate](skills/quality-gate/SKILL.md) | Sets up a ratchet quality gate — a PR may add code but never regress a metric (coverage, duplication, lint, large files, complexity, dependencies, mutation, benchmarks, vulns) — plus an AI babysitting loop that drives the PR to green. |
| [brag-me](skills/brag-me/SKILL.md) | Turns your real contributions to a project into evidence-backed resume bullets, pulled from git history, merged PRs, and quality-gate metric trends. |
| [profile-me](skills/profile-me/SKILL.md) | Writes professional-branding content — LinkedIn, résumé, portfolio, Lattes — from validated facts, using the X-Y-Z method, honest metrics, per-channel formatting, and no cross-section redundancy. Chains with `brag-me` (which harvests the facts). |
| [secret-scan](skills/secret-scan/SKILL.md) | Scans the working tree (git-aware) and full git history for exposed secrets — API keys, tokens, private keys, passwords, and insecure `${VAR:-default}` fallbacks — redacts every match, and exits non-zero as a CI/pre-commit gate. |

## Quality gate — metric waves

The `quality-gate` ratchet grew in waves; a project can adopt them in order as it matures. Same engine throughout — pick how much runs with `--preset=lite|full`, or an explicit `metrics` list in the config.

| Stage | Metrics | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Base (`--preset=lite`) | coverage, duplication, lint, large files, vulnerabilities | The five fundamentals; no extra tooling needed. |
| Wave 1 | cyclomatic complexity, circular dependencies | Cheap, high signal; complexity reuses the lint report, dependencies via `madge`. |
| Wave 2 | mutation score | Slow (reruns the suite per mutant) — only meaningful once the test suite is solid. Own CI job. |
| Wave 3 | microbenchmarks | Per-named-bench timing, judged against a symmetric tolerance band (default ±10%) because CI timing is noisy. Own CI job. |
| Pass/fail (not ratcheted) | e2e, regression | Binary suites, run as separate required CI jobs — not `baseline.json` metrics. See [REFERENCE §3b](skills/quality-gate/REFERENCE.md). |

## Attribution

`marclou-review` is not original work — it packages the 31 rules from Marc Lou's newsletter as an agent-checkable rubric. Full credit and original writeup: [31 Principles of a Viral Product](https://newsletter.marclou.com/p/31-principles-of-a-viral-product).

`grill-while-coding` is an adaptation of Matt Pocock's `grill-me` skill — same interrogation idea, moved from pre-plan interview to inline checks during implementation. Full credit: [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills).

`write-a-skill` is not original work — it's Matt Pocock's skill, unmodified. Full credit: [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/productivity/write-a-skill/SKILL.md).

`pentest-me` is original work — a defense-in-depth pentest method that scores attacks by layer depth rather than running a checklist scanner.

`quality-gate` implements the ratchet quality-gate and AI-babysitting method from Lucas Montano's video [Como garantir qualidade de código com IA](https://youtu.be/qToBgU8K4Ms). The concept (baseline + no-regression ratchet + babysitting) is his; the packaged script, per-stack recipes, and CI workflow are this repo's implementation.

`brag-me` is original work — the automation is this repo's. The underlying "brag document" idea is Julia Evans' ([jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)).

`profile-me` is original work. The X-Y-Z bullet method it uses is Laszlo Bock's (Google) formula; the LinkedIn field mechanics are common platform practice, distilled.

`secret-scan` is original work — a named-pattern secret scanner in the spirit of gitleaks/trufflehog, git-history-aware and redaction-first, packaged as a standalone skill.
